🌱 About EcoCred Web

EcoCred Web is a gamified environmental education and action platform designed to make sustainability fun, measurable, and community-driven.

Through interactive lessons, quizzes, and real-world eco tasks, students earn points, badges, and ranks while teachers track engagement and impact. Every verified action from planting trees to reducing plastic contributes to a collective leaderboard, inspiring competition and collaboration.

Built with Next.js, MongoDB, and a modern UI stack, EcoCred combines the best of edtech and green-tech. The platform is self-hosted on Coolify, giving full control over deployment, scalability, and security.

Our mission is simple:
Turn climate education into climate action one student, one task, one school at a time. 🌍✨
